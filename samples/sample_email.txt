Hello Flowbit Team,

We are currently evaluating options for deploying a lightweight multi-agent system in our enterprise R&D division. We would like a formal quotation for the following:

- Deployment of 3 custom agents (including intent classification)
- Integration with Ollama-based LLMs
- Shared memory persistence (SQLite preferred)
- Email and JSON routing capabilities

Please let us know the expected cost, timelines, and licensing model.

Best regards,
