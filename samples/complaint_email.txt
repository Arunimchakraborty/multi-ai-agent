Dear Support Team,

I am writing to raise a complaint regarding a discrepancy in the invoice we received on May 24, 2025 (Invoice ID: INV-56823).

The billed amount does not match the terms agreed upon in our service contract, and there are additional charges listed that we did not authorize. This is causing delays in our internal processing and payment cycle.

Please investigate and send us a corrected invoice at the earliest. If this issue is not resolved within the next two business days, we may be forced to escalate it further.

Attached are the relevant documents for your reference.

Regards,
Daniel Khan
